# Town Hall Checklist 

Looking to organize a town hall to discuss open science with your team or community? Here are some tips to get started! 

## Why do a Town Hall? 
The tradition of town halls dates back to the 17th century, when an entire town would get together to debate new rules, share news, and make decisions that would affect the entire community (source: [*When the People Speak*](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199604432.001.0001)). A modern town hall meeting often has elements of presentations, panel discussions, and community feedback. To organize a Town Hall focused on the science and research community we suggest the following:

### Lead with Purpose
A town hall meeting ideally ends with either a decision being made OR feedback being gathered on a previous decision. In your open science town hall, this decision could be changing team rules to allow for pre-prints, mandate sharing of code immediately upon publication of research, or convincing folks to sign up for open science training. The purpose may also be getting feedback on an [open science action plan](/Open_Science_Cookbook/Your_Organizations_Open_Science_Journey.md#develop-governance-frameworks-and-policies-to-support-open-science-action-plans), or hearing from a group of open science experts on different open science strategies that may work for your team, and then discussing as a group which of those strategies you will adopt.
