# Panel Checklist

Are you participating in an open science panel or hoping to set one up yourself? This guide includes tips, tricks, and a checklist both for an organizer and a potential panelist. 

## Checklist for the Panel Organizer
Cassie Kozyrkov's Medium blog has several excellent posts on panel preperation including, ["How to Organize a Panel"](https://medium.com/hackernoon/how-to-organize-a-panel-676b9d82d678), ["Top 10 panel disasters and how to avoid them"](https://medium.com/hackernoon/top-10-panel-disasters-and-how-to-avoid-them-c37535a6438e), and ["Public speaking masterclass: Everything in moderation"](https://kozyrkov.medium.com/public-speaking-masterclass-everything-in-moderation-ea286e0188d8) which is about being a panel moderator. We also pull from Karen Kelsky's ["The Professor is In: How to Organize a Panel for a Conference"](https://theprofessorisin.com/2013/03/15/how-to-organize-a-panel-for-a-conference/) and Kristy Law's ["A Complete Guide to Panel Discusions"](https://oxfordabstracts.com/blog/a-complete-guide-to-panel-discussions/).
