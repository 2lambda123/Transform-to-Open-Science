# Presentation Checklist

Ready to give a presentation on open science? We've curated a checklist to help you put together your **slides**! Looking for tips on giving the talk? Head over to the [keynote checklist](./keynote/keynote_checklist.md). 

The focus of this checklist is tips on creating a great slide deck that will support the story you are telling your audience. The tricky part is to balance "captivating" with "accessible." Slides with too many words aren't great, but slides with an over-complicated graphic could just as easily lose your audience. Looking for visual examples? 

Here are a few videos we recommend:
* An in-depth walk-through of how to give great science presentations by Susan McConnell from Stanford University is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp7Id3Yb9XQ). The video is almost 45 minutes long, so we recommend using the time-stamps in the video description to jump ahead to the part that interests you most. Some suggestions are [21:21 Minimum essential components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp7Id3Yb9XQ&t=1281s), [25:19 Structure of a good talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp7Id3Yb9XQ&t=1519s), and [29:27 Meat & Taters; Keeping the audience's attention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp7Id3Yb9XQ&t=1767s).
* A brief crash-course in using PowerPoint to the fullest by Science Infographics is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp7Id3Yb9XQ&t=1767s). This video is five-minutes long and has some great suggestions for using animations, shape tools, and other PowerPoint tricks to create a minimalist but informative talk. Google Slides has many of the the same features, making the video fairly versatile.
