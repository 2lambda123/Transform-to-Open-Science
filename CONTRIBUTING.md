## Welcome!

We're so glad you're interested in contributing to Transform to Open Science!

Before contributing, in addition to reading our CONTRIBUTING guide (you are here), we also ask you to read our [LICENSE](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/LICENSE.MD), our [README](https://github.com/reeseIngraham/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/README.md), and our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/reeseIngraham/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Understanding Your Role
Depending on your level of interaction with TOPS and the TOPS GitHub, visitors to the site can be described as: 
- A **community member**: anyone in the open science community who visits a TOPS site, utilizes TOPS online tools, or attends a TOPS event.
- A **participant**: anyone who posts a comment or poses a question in the *GitHub Discussion Space*, reports a site bug or requests a new resource in *GitHub Issues*, or attends a TOPS event and utilizes any virtual chat features during that event. 
- A **contributor**: anyone who forks this GitHub repository and submits pull requests to make additions or changes to the posted content. If you wish to be a contributor, please read our contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

Everyone reading this wiki is a community member, and we hope everyone will post comments and join discussions as a participant. Contributors are welcome, particularly to help find and point to other open science resources. 

All community members must abide by the code of conduct when engaging with TOPS, either online or in-person.

## GitHub Basics
There are three, major ways to contribute to the TOPS GitHub. 
- **Ask a question, provide an answer, share your thoughts and contribute to brainstorming through [Discussions](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/discussions).** The GitHub discussion area is intended for general Q&A, asking for community stories and experiences, and beginning conversations on new or existing open science topics. 
  - To learn more about GitHub Discussions check out their [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions) 
- **Suggest a change, addition, or deletion to what is already on the GitHub using [Issues](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/issues).** Issues can be about any TOPS plans, timelines, and content.
  - To learn more about GitHub Issues check out their [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)
- Become a contributor! [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository and [make commits](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-and-pushing-changes) to add resources and additional materials.
