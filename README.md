# Transform to OPen Science (TOPS)

## What We Do

The world is changing rapidly. Everyday new problems emerge and it takes groundbreaking scientific discoveries to solve them. To stay ahead, the pace of science must accelerate and science needs to be even better, more accurate, and faster to enable the truly transformative breakthroughs that will help us thrive. Closed science, hoarding information and resources, silos of knowledge holds science back. We need more voices that work together and share knowledge and resources. Only then will we find new and unexpected solutions. Transforming to Open Science (TOPS) will allow us to create a scientific culture that is ready for 21st century challenges. Open Science will **broaden participation, increase accessibility to knowledge, and embrace new technologies** that can respond to these changes at scale. We hope you will join us in creating an open science infrastructure in your organization. TOPS will show you how! 

## Goals

Open Science creates more advanced and inclusive research faster, builds a more just and equitable world, and ensures that minds from all walks of life can participate in science. TOPS is NASA’s ambitious plan to accelerate open science practices. It’s a 5 year journey that will  
1. Increase understanding and adoption of open science principles and techniques 
2. Accelerate major scientific discoveries 
3. Broaden participation by historically excluded communities 

## TOPS and the Year of Open Science

2023 is the Year Of Open Science, a global community initiative to spark change and inspire open science engagement through events and activities that will shift the current paradigm and change practices. *The Transform to Open Science (TOPS) project coordinates efforts designed to rapidly transform agencies, organizations, and communities.*

## Implementation
- [Area 1: Engagement](./docs/Area1_Engagement/readme.md): Building community, publishing articles, appearing on podcasts, expanding knowledge about open science, integrating Open Science into themes at large-scale events and conferences.
- [Area 2: Capacity sharing](./docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/readme.md): Producing online, free, open science curriculum, hosting workshops, events, cohorts, science team meetings, hackathons, and constructing multiple pathways to an Open Science Badge.
- [Area 3: Incentives](./docs/Area3_Incentives/readme.md): Developing Open Science Badge/Certification and establishing high profile awards in support of open science research.
- [Area 4: Moving towards openness](./docs/Area4_Moving_To_Openness/readme.md): Recognizing open science practices, holding open meetings, sharing hidden knowledge, and inclusive collaborations.
