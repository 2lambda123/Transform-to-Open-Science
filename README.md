# Transform to OPen Science (TOPS)

Accelerating scientific discovery and equity with Open Science

## Overview

* Designate 2023 as the Year of Open Science within a 5-year push to Transform to open science. 
* Jump-start a suite of coordinated activities designed to support adoption of open science.

## Goals

* Increase understanding and adoption of open science principles and techniques 
* Accelerate major scientific discoveries 
* Broaden participation by historically excluded communities 

## Implementation
- [Area 1: Engagement](./docs/Area1_Engagement/readme.md): Building community, publishing articles, appearing on podcasts, expanding knowledge about open science, integrating Open Science into themes at large-scale events and conferences.
- [Area 2: Capacity sharing](./docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/readme.md): Producing online, free, open science curriculum, hosting workshops, events, cohorts, science team meetings, hackathons, and constructing multiple pathways to an Open Science Badge.
- [Area 3: Incentives](./docs/Area3_Incentives/readme.md): Developing Open Science Badge/Certification and establishing high profile awards in support of open science research.
- [Area 4: Moving towards openness](./docs/Area4_Moving_To_Openness/readme.md): Recognizing open science practices, holding open meetings, sharing hidden knowledge, and inclusive collaborations.
