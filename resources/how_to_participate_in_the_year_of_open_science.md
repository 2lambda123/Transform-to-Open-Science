  <h4>What is the Year of Open Science?</h4>
  Transform to Open Science (TOPS) is a five-year initiative designed to support scientists, agencies, organizations, and communities as they transform to an inclusive culture of open science. Many TOPS activities will be focused around 2023 as NASAâ€™s Year of Open Science. In partnership with major scientific organizations, the Year of Open Science is designed to spark change and inspire open science engagement through events and activities that will shift the current paradigm.
