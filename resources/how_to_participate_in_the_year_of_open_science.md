<h1>NASA’s Year of Open Science</h1>
<h2>Collaborator Guides</h2>
The Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission is designed to rapidly transform agencies, organizations, and communities to an inclusive culture of open science.

<h2>Open Science</h2>
Open science—opening up the scientific process from idea inception to result—increases access to knowledge and expands opportunities for participation. Sharing the data, code, results, and knowledge associated with the scientific process enables more inclusive, diverse and equitable participation in science, while also leading to more transparent, replicable and reproducible results. But achieving this openness requires changing how we work, to help us move forward together.

<h2>NASA’s Transform to Open Science mission</h2>
To help catalyze the move to open science and support changing cultural norms, NASA is championing the Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission and has declared 2023 as the Year Of Open Science. TOPS  is a $40 million, 5-year NASA Science Mission Directorate mission geared towards accelerating the adoption and understanding of open science. TOPS will focus on four areas of action—engagement, capacity sharing, incentives, and moving towards openness—to make progress against three goals:
<ol>
    <li> To accelerate major scientific discoveries
    <li> To increase understanding and adoption of open science
    <li> To broaden participation by historically underrepresented communities
</ol>
These areas are designed to increase awareness about open science, provide learning resources for those looking to deepen their understanding and usage of open science practices and principles, and to promote events that support transitioning to open science. By partnering and collaborating with other organizations, NASA will support and enable the scientific community to move towards open science. 

<h4> The success of the Year of Open Science will be driven by the enthusiasm and level of engagement of partnering organizations, who can undertake any number of the discrete tasks listed below to promote, engage with, and strengthen the Year of Open Science! </h4>

  An organization is ready to strengthen the Year of Open science if they have already begun to adopt open science principles into the workflow of their organization. An individual is ready to strengthen the Year of Open Science if they have already adopted a few open science practices.
