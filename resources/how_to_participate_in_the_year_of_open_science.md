<h1>NASA’s Year of Open Science</h1>
<h2>Collaborator Guides</h2>
The Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission is designed to rapidly transform agencies, organizations, and communities to an inclusive culture of open science.

<h2>Open Science</h2>
Open science—opening up the scientific process from idea inception to result—increases access to knowledge and expands opportunities for participation. Sharing the data, code, results, and knowledge associated with the scientific process enables more inclusive, diverse and equitable participation in science, while also leading to more transparent, replicable and reproducible results. But achieving this openness requires changing how we work, to help us move forward together.

<h2>NASA’s Transform to Open Science mission</h2>
To help catalyze the move to open science and support changing cultural norms, NASA is championing the Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission and has declared 2023 as the Year Of Open Science. TOPS  is a $40 million, 5-year NASA Science Mission Directorate mission geared towards accelerating the adoption and understanding of open science. TOPS will focus on four areas of action—engagement, capacity sharing, incentives, and moving towards openness—to make progress against three goals:
<ol>
    <li> To accelerate major scientific discoveries
    <li> To increase understanding and adoption of open science
    <li> To broaden participation by historically underrepresented communities
</ol>
These areas are designed to increase awareness about open science, provide learning resources for those looking to deepen their understanding and usage of open science practices and principles, and to promote events that support transitioning to open science. By partnering and collaborating with other organizations, NASA will support and enable the scientific community to move towards open science. 

<h4> The success of the Year of Open Science will be driven by the enthusiasm and level of engagement of partnering organizations, who can undertake any number of the discrete tasks listed below to promote, engage with, and strengthen the Year of Open Science! </h4>

    <h4>Encourage Participation in the TOPS Open Science Curriculum</h4>
    <b>What is it?</b>
    Whether someone is looking to transition to a new way of conducting research or just getting started in their scientific career, TOPS aims to meet everyone where they are at on their open science journey. As such, one of TOPS' priorities is to develop and launch an open science curriculum that includes important definitions, tools, resources and best practices. You can learn more about the TOPS curriculum on our GitHub in <a href="https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/tree/main/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing">Area2_Capacity_Sharing</a>.<br>
A “fast-pass” option will be available for those who are already well-versed in open science, and current open science practitioners will be able to complete activities in order to earn the final TOPS open science badge. For those who prefer to go through the full course, micro-badges will be available at every module and the TOPS open science badge will be awarded at the end. (Why badging?

    <h4>Highlight Organizational Subject Matter Experts in Open Science</h4>
    <b>What is it?</b> Consider your organization’s current open science practice: do researchers use or share open-source code, are pre-prints encouraged or required, is data added to a database or are studies pre-registered? Open science can take many forms, and each is valid. Highlight some open science subject matter experts from your organization at your next community event or online, to demonstrate how research by your organization is already adopting open science practices.<br>
    <b>How do I get started?</b> Depending on the structure of your organization, there may already be a list of those who are freely sharing their research practices or results. Start with that list, and see if any researchers would be interested in speaking to the broader group about how they got started with open science.<br>
    Other organizations may need to spend some time brainstorming, ideally through a platform that allows for diverse participation, about ways in which scientists at that organization are embracing open science. That brainstorming exercise can serve the dual purpose of getting those in the community who were unaware they were doing open science, or not practicing it as of yet, interested in the movement.<br>
    Unsure whether your organization has researchers who are already practicing open science? We recommend the following article to get started: Ummul-Kiram Kathawalla, Priya Silverstein, Moin Syed; Easing Into Open Science: A Guide for Graduate Students and Their Advisors. Collabra: Psychology 4 January 2021; 7 (1): 18684. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.18684">https://doi.org/10.1525/collabra.18684</a>.
    <h5>Basic Requirements</h5>
    When highlighting your organization’s open science subject matter experts (SMEs), you are doing more than just sharing a project that was done according to open science principles; you are also giving those just beginning their open science journey a model to follow. Therefore, to ensure the success of these researchers, we recommend the following be included in the blog, web-page, or meeting in which you highlight the open science SMEs:
    <ol>
        <li> The elements of open science included in their work and research practices (including links to digital elements).
        <li> Any challenges faced when adopting those open science practices, and how to overcome them.
        <li> Links to the open code, data, or publication archives of your organization.
        <li> Links to the publication, license, and/or copyright policies of your organization. 
    </ol>
    You may also want to consider providing information on the data management plans and publication policies of any federal organizations who contribute to funding for researchers at your organization. Links to many of those policies can be found on the TOPS GitHub at Open Timeline. 
    <h5> TOPS Will Provide </h5>
    To help make this effort a success, TOPS will provide organizations with the following support:
    <ol>
        <li> Resources on getting started with open science, which can be found in the open science curriculum pages at Capacity Sharing: OpenCore.
        <li> Year of Open Science branding packet, including templates for stickers, presentation templates, Zoom backgrounds, and a guide for the use of NASA’s and TOPS’ logo and name.
    </ol>
    <h4>Highlight Open Science in Your Organization</h4>
    <b>What is it?</b> Consider your organization’s current open science practice: do researchers use or share open-source code, are pre-prints encouraged or required, is data added to a database or are studies pre-registered? What policies are in place regarding sharing code, instrument data, user surveys, methodology and results? How about instructions regarding licenses and copyrights? Those beginning their open science journey often worry that they aren’t truly engaging in “open science” if they are unable to practice openness in every way. At TOPS, we believe it is better to get started and do what you can, than let perfect be the enemy of progress. Show those at your organization how you are beginning an open science journey, by making it easier for everyone to find and access the relevant resources and policies. <br>
    <b>How do I get started?</b> Start by examining official policies that are already in place, including any that mention pre-registration, pre-prints, open access, code, data, research artifacts, publication, licenses, copyrights, meta-data, persistent digital identifiers, digital object identifiers, and/or collaboration. Collect the relevant policies in one location and, if possible, write a “directory” to passages in these policies that align with open science principles. Next, examine any “unofficial” policies; what are the research norms at your organization? Can any be updated to be more inclusive, equitable, accessible, or transparent? Address some of these, as appropriate, in a statement that accompanies the new open science directory. <br>
    <h5>Basic Requirements</h5>
    When highlighting how your organization is already engaging in open science, you are doing more than just sharing projects that were done according to open science principles; you are also giving those just beginning their open science journey a model to follow. Therefore, to ensure the success of these researchers, we recommend the following be included in the blog, web-page, or meeting in which you list the relevant policies and practices:
    <ol>
        <li> Directory of organizational policies which include open science principles.
        <li> Examples (provide links) of publications that followed the open science policies that you are highlighting. The projects chosen may not be good examples of every open science principle, and that is okay! Describe what was done well, and point to the relevant organizational practice and/or policy.
    </ol>
    <h5>TOPS Will Provide</h5>
    To help make this effort a success, TOPS will provide organizations with the following support:
    <ol>
        <li> Resources on getting started with open science, which can be found in the open science curriculum pages at Capacity Sharing: OpenCore.
        <li> Year of Open Science branding packet, including templates for stickers, presentation templates, Zoom backgrounds, and a guide for the use of NASA’s and TOPS’ logo and name.
    </ol>
    <h4>Host a Listening Session</h4>
    <b>What is it?</b> A listening session is an open meeting in which the primary role of leaders is to listen to the feedback, ideas, critiques, and thoughts of the people in their organization. Often, listening sessions are moderated by someone with training in either mediation, conflict resolution, or transformative justice, to ensure that communication is honest, open, and respectful. Attendance is normally capped at twenty participants or less, to make sure that everyone who is present has a chance to speak. NPR has additional information on how to get started in their article “Six ways to run a listening session.” <br>
    An open science listening session at your organization would give researchers and scientists an opportunity to express the ways in which they believe your organization is actively advancing open science practices, and areas in which progress could be accelerated.<br>
    <b>How do I get started?</b> Depending on the organization, you may have a group or a person which specializes in moderation, running conferences or meetings, or provides anti-bias, diversity, or conflict-resolution training. Reach out to this group/person and ask them if they would be willing to host and moderate an open science listening session. Once the moderator has been identified, choose a date, time, and forum for the event. Virtual attendance may be easiest, particularly if the group is geographically diverse. Then advertise!<br>
    Listening sessions work best when attendance is limited, to ensure that everyone who attends gets a voice at the table. Best practice is that attendance should be limited to twenty people. If more than twenty folks are interested, you may have to run several listening sessions to get the feedback necessary to generate change.<br>
    If running a listening session will be too challenging (perhaps your organization is too large, or there is no one with training in moderation), a town hall format–in which there is someone sourcing questions but no active moderation, and a larger crowd in attendance–may be a bit easier.
    <h4>Basic Requirements</h4>
    To help the listening session be successful, we recommend the following:
    <ol>
        <li> Create an environment which is inclusive and respectful.
        <li> If there will be twenty attendees, then maybe consider having only three or four organizational leaders present to hear the feedback. A note-take can be appointed, to bring the areas for improvement to a greater number of leaders.
        <li> Choose (or create) a code of conduct prior to the meeting, and make sure everyone in attendance sees it ahead of time. Open the meeting by pointing to that code of conduct, and saying that anyone who violates it will be asked to leave.
        <li> If one attendee is “dominating the airwaves,” the moderator should feel encouraged to reach out to them individually (perhaps via chat) to respectfully ask them to make space for the others in the room.
        <li> Send out conversation prompts ahead of the meeting, to give attendees time to consider their responses. People will appreciate having time to prepare. 
     </ol>
    <h4>TOPS Will Provide</h4>
    To help make this event a success, TOPS will provide organizations with the following support:
    <ol>
        <li> Resources on getting started with open science, which can be found in the open science curriculum pages at Capacity Sharing: OpenCore.
        <li> Year of Open Science branding packet, including templates for stickers, presentation templates, Zoom backgrounds, and a guide for the use of NASA’s and TOPS’ logo and name.
    </ol>
