# Organizing a workshop

Workshops that teach about open science can be organized everywhere! Are you attending a conference and want to organize a TOPS workshop? We can help!

Here is all you need for a self-organized workshop. 

TOPS welcomes you to organize and run your own workshop. Please connect with any of our trained instructors(TBD) who can teach the workshop. First, please notify us that you intend to organize a workshop by registering your workshop here(TBD). Most workshops will teach one or more modules from OpenCore.

Start with our [checklist](workshop_checklist.md).

A TOPS workshop must meet the following requirements:

- Have at least one certified instructor
- Must use The TOPS OpenCore or ScienceCore curriculum
