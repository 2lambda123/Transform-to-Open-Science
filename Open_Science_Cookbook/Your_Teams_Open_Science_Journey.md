# Guide for Your Team's Open Science Journey

After deepening [your understanding of open science](./Your_Open_Science_Journey.md), you may be inspired to adopt some open science principles in the day-to-day operations of your lab or research group. Collaborate with colleagues to consider the next steps that can be taken to adopt open science as a team, and use the resources below to get you started!

Looking to inspire your team-mates to also adopt open science? Begin with **[Section 1: Engage With Open Science](./Your_Teams_Open_Science_Journey.md#section-1-engage-with-open-science)**

Ready to re-build some of your team practices to better mirror open science principles? Skip ahead to **[Section 2: Strengthen Open Science](./Your_Teams_Open_Science_Journey.md#section-2-strengthen-open-science)**

## Is your team ready to embark on a journey towards open science? 

## Section 1: Engage With Open Science

### Explore the Open Science Toolkit of the National Academies 
We invite all our partners to read and adapt the recommendations from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine workshop in 2021, “Developing a Toolkit for Fostering Open Science Practices: Proceedings of a Workshop.” Which can be found at [https://doi.org/10.17226/26308](https://doi.org/10.17226/26308). 

In particular, the Toolkit Materials in Appendix C provide resources for:
* Drafting an institution statement of support for open science methods and practices (pages 33 to 45)
* Examples of successful and impactful open science work such as the Human Genome Project and the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (pages 36 to 39)
* A sample template and rubric for assessing a grant/job application for adherence to open science principles (pages 46 to 69)
* A series of short primers on various open-science topics (pages 70 to 92)

## Section 2: Strengthen Open Science

### Discuss Your Team's Data and Research Products
Open Science calls for researchers to strive to open their entire research life-cyle--from idea generation to final publications and code--so that others can build on their work. Research data should be as open as is possible without compromising personal identying information, national or personal security, or violating research ethics. 

This can seem like a daunting task, but any amount of openness, such as putting publications on an open-access server or using persistent digital identifiers, helps make data more accessible. Sit down with your team and discuss the following, and see if you are able to make some of your processes more open:
* Consider the data you use or generate: 
    * Where can researchers find your data? What is your process/method for releasing data? Can portions of it be anonymized such that it can be shared? Is the process for requesting access to your data clear? How fast is the data request process and how often do you go through the process of releasing data? Does your organization have practices around pre-registration and archiving? Are these practices well-known and front-of-mind?
    * [Registry of Research Data Repositories](https://www.re3data.org/) is an example site for finding open databases 
* If your team produces its own research, consider if:
    * Research plans may be made available, prior to the start of the project, 
    * That reproducibility/replicability studies be valued and encouraged, and
    * That null/negative results be published. 
    * Some examples of making research plans available can be found at [AsPredicted](https://aspredicted.org/), [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/), and [Registered Reports](https://cos.io/rr/) 
    * Examples of journals that publish negative/nul results include Positively Negative (PLOS One), The Missing Pieces: A Collection of Negative; Null and Inconclusive Results (PLOS One), The All Results Journals, ACS Omega (ACS Publications), F1000Research, PeerJ, Journal of Negative Results in Biomedicine, Journal of Negative Results: Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis, Journal of Pharmaceutical Negative results and Nature Scientific Reports
    * Examples of journals that publish reproducibility/replicability studies are PLOS ONE, and [Royal Society](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/rsos/replication-studies)
* If your team produces its own research OR uses research created by others, consider: 
    * Do you require that the list of materials, study methods, and computational environment be included in the final results which are shared publicly? If not, consider making this a requirement of the project. 
* For data or research produced *by* your organization: 
    * In what languages is the research available? Are bilingual researchers encouraged to apply for funding? Or, better yet, publish in multiple languages? 
    * Consider adding extensions to your databases, publication sites, or other methods of sharing data to allow for easy translation into other languages. 
* Does yoru team develop software or other code artifacts/products? 
    * Can this code be made publicly available via GitHub, BitBucket or other mechanisms? 
    * Consider how much of the work of your group ought to be kept “closed” and how much can be made available to advance the work of others, particularly young professionals and early career researchers.
