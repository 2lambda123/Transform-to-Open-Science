# Why do Open Science?

When properly implemented, open science policies promote “efficiency, greater collaboration, reduced duplication, . . . a broadening of the user community, improved code testing, more reproducible research, and enhance[d] research transparency” ([NASEM, 2018](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25116/open-science-by-design-realizing-a-vision-for-21st-century), p. 3).

The list below outlines four key benefits of open science. These benefits have been demonstrated in the scientific community through the open science products of publications, data, software, and general scientific knowledge (Burgelman et al., 2019).

## Accessibility

- Citizen science initiatives and engagement
- Lifesaving access to medical and scientific information
- Democratization of the scientific process
- Increased Earth observation accessibility

## Efficiency & Innovation

- Cleaner, more secure code with more contributors
- More long-term maintenance assistance from the community
- New monetized offices and data centers
- Financially sound, streamlined, and transparent research spending

## Reproducibility

- Increased transparency of results from research
- More reliable results with confirmation of previous findings
- Less pressure to come up with ‘exciting’ research in order to be published 
- More robust products of the scientific method  

## Diversity & Inclusion

- International accessibility
- Breakdown of some systemic financial and funding barriers 
- Diversity among researchers and scientists
- Equitable distribution of opportunity
