# Module 4: Open Data

## Objectives: 
By the end of this module, learners should feel comfortable creating a data management plan that follows FAIR principles, including assigning a license/copyright, metadata tagging, and assigning PIDs. Learners should also feel comfortable utilizing and assigning metadata. 

Key Terms: Copyright, license, CC-BY and CC0 license, data management plan, metadata, machine-readable persistent identifiers (PID), findable (data), accessible (data), interoperable, reusable (data), privacy, sensitivity, de-identification, mediated access, crawl and mine [research articles], analytical reproducibility, dataflow 

## Topics: 



1. FAIR principles and data
   - What to do with sensitive and/or proprietary data? 
2. Basics of copyrights and licenses
   - Exercise/Assignment: Choosing a copyright 
3. The importance of data packaging (e.g., READ ME for explainability and context), data citation and metadata. Importance of tracking changes and keeping copies.
   - Principles of metadata ([examples](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015EA000136)) 
4. How to identify a “trustworthy” data repository
5. How to write a data management plan
   - Exercise/Assignment: Data management plan 
6. Metadata: What is it? How do I use it? And how do I make sure my data has it? 
7. How to cite databases and data
   - Exercise/Assignment: Citing data
8. Open Discussion: The argument for databases as “publications” or rewarding the accumulation of high-quality data as noteworthy accomplishments
