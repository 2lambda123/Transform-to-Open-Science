# Module 4: Open Data

## Objectives: 
By the end of this module, learners should feel comfortable creating a data management plan that follows FAIR principles, including assigning a license/copyright, metadata tagging, and assigning PIDs. Learners should also feel comfortable utilizing and assigning metadata. 

Key Terms: Copyright, license, CC-BY and CC0 license, data management plan, metadata, machine-readable persistent identifiers (PID), findable (data), accessible (data), interoperable, reusable (data), privacy, sensitivity, de-identification, mediated access, crawl and mine [research articles], analytical reproducibility, dataflow 

## Topics: 

1. Why share data? 
1. Common fears about sharing data
1. How you share matters:
     - Restrictions
     - Data repositories
     - Data licenses 
     - Data DOIs
     - Documentation, metadata, FAIR
1. How to attribute/cite data
