# Module 3: Open Software 

## Objectives: 
At the end of this module, learners will understand the impact of open-source code, and have hands-on practice with choosing a license, creating a README, and uploading code to GitHub/GitLab. Learners will understand the importance of high-quality and documented code. Learners will discuss the impact of open-source software on open science and advancing equity in scientific fields. 

Key Terms: open-source software, source vs. compiled code, permissive vs. non-permissive license, version control, README, documentation, code repository vs. software repository

# Topics: 



1. Why share code?
    1. Sharing software as a form of improving impact, reproducibility and and replicability of research
    2. “If the code is good enough to publish a paper, then it is good enough to share” 
2. Code repositories and software repositories
3. Importance of documentation to open-source software
    - Exercise/Assignment: Creating a README
4. How to attribute/cite open-source software 
5. Quality requirements for sharing code 
    - Exercise/Assignment: Practice with common code-sharing tools such as GitHub, GitLab, Jupyter and Zenodo 
6. Choosing an appropriate license 
    - Exercise/Assignment: Choosing a license
7. Open Discussion: Why is open-source software critical to the decolonization of science and for advancing diversity and equity in science and research?
