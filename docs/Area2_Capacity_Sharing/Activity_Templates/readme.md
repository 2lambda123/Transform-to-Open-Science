# Organizing Open Science Activities

The Transform to Open Science (TOPS) team knows that we are only a small part of a larger movement towards open science. Anyone can bring open science to their community by elevating open science best practices, principles, and successes in public forums, lab meetings, conference sessions, and anywhere else we gather. If you are interested in sharing open science at your next event but...
- Are unsure where to start,
- Would like TOPS or a member of the TOPS community to join you, or
- Want an example of successfully submitted talks...

These resources are for you!
