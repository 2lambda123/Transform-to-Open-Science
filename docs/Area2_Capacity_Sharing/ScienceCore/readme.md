# TOPS Science Curriculum : ScienceCore


# Scope:

As NASA moves towards more open science requirements (eg. [Scientific Information policy](https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/Scientific%20Information%20policy%20SPD-41.pdf) and ROSES funding opportunities) scientists will need to acquire new skills to participate in open science effectively and to demonstrate those skills when applying for NASA funding opportunities. TOPS first priority is to develop the infrastructure to train 20K scientists. For the 2023 Year of Open Science, NASA is developing strategic partnerships with large scientific associations to ‘teach’ open science during the large annual meetings, special science team summer schools, and other events. To support these activities, NASA needs to enable the development of open science curriculum content. The vision for the TOPS learning resources is for CC-BY licensed Massive Online Open Course (MOOC), hosted on the openEDx platform, that can be used to train scientists and award NASA open science badges. 


# Learning objective:

Once scientists have these basic open science skills, they will need advanced data science and domain specific curriculum content to continue learning. For some learners, it is these domain specific modules that may attract them to learning more about open science. The focus of the curriculum will give the learners the necessary data science skills needed to advance open science and work with NASA cloud-based data.


# Incentive to take the course

How do we motivate busy scientists to take this course? What is in it for them? Brainstorm below:



* NASA can emphasize using cloud-based data preferable.
* Encourage publishers to require publishing executable notebooks.
* Creating executable NASA progress reports?

# Description:


The design is for individual 2.5-hour modules that focus on data science skills (GitHub, coding best practices, creating executable notebooks, accessing cloud data, domain specific examples…) that can be taught in-person during large society meetings, each morning of a week-long science team meeting, completed individually online, or in group-organized online events. 



* Each MOOC module is a 2.5-hour interactive learning experience with slides, videos, quizzes, and activities. 
* All content will be integrated into an openEDx MOOC and a JupyterBook that will be integrated into the TOPS website. All content will be assigned a CC0 or CC-BY license.

# Requirement for each module (Deliverables):

Each module includes:



* 3-hour schedule (2.5-hours of content and two 15 minute breaks)
* Slides, scripts, videos for MOOC
* Quiz questions for MOOCs
* Activities workbooks


# Course Enrollment and Teaching Events


* MOOC that can be completed independently. This requires using a platform like OpenEDx to track progress. 
* In-person teaching at large society meetings
* In-person teaching at science team meetings 
* Online cohorts with weekly meetings to help progression through the course 


# Course Creation

* ROSES for individual modules? Discipline specific modules? Module groups?
* Who verifies quality and accepts into MOOC?


# **Certification / Badging**



* Ability to track completion of modules in MOOC, in-person, and online events.
    * Track what modules have been completed either online or in-person or independent (MOOC). 
* Fast-track - ?
