# Module 5: Open Tools & Resources

## We need your feedback on the OpenCore!

To contribute to the building of the Open Tools & Resources module, please refer to [these instructions](/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/OpenCore/readme.md#your-feedback-is-needed).

# Learning Objectives
1. Explain why open science tools encourage responsible open science   (e.g., using the FAIR and CARE principles)  
2. Identify Open Science communities and initiatives - within and across disciplines - and join a community of practice (CoP) of interest to you  
3. Provide examples of how open science is practiced in a research team  
4. Identify types of Open Science tools along with their purpose  
5. Match appropriate open science tools to specific objectives within the research workflow  
6. Describe 3-5 open science tools and how to use them in projects (e.g., for communication, sharing of results, giving credit, and collaboration)

# Module Outline
Lesson 1: Introduction to Open Science tools
