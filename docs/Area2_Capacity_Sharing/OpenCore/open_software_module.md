# Module 3: Open Software 

# Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, learners will understand the impact of open-source code, and have hands-on practice with choosing a license, creating a README, and uploading code to GitHub/GitLab. Learners will understand the importance of high-quality and documented code. Learners will discuss the impact of open-source software on open science and advancing equity in scientific fields.

# Suggested Module Topics
1. Explain the benefits and challenges that producing open software encompasses.
2. Be able to identify resources for Open Software relevant for a scientific field.
3. Identify key markers of open software in code
4. How to cite othersâ€™ software in publications
5. Differentiate open, reproducible, and executable code
6. Publish software openly so others may access, use, and grow the software
