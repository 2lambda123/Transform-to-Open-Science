# Module 3: Open Software 

## We need your feedback on the OpenCore!

To contribute to the building of the Open Software module, please refer to [these instructions](/docs/Area2_Capacity_Sharing/OpenCore/readme.md#your-feedback-is-needed).

# Learning Objectives
1. Explain the benefits and challenges that producing open software encompasses.
2. Be able to identify resources for Open Software relevant for a scientific field.
3. Identify key markers of open software in code
4. How to cite others’ software in publications
5. Differentiate open, reproducible, and executable code
6. Publish software openly so others may access, use, and grow the software
