# Proposed OpenCore Structure

The purpose of the Transform to Open Science curriculum, the OpenCore, is to introduce NASA-funded scientists or future NASA-funded scientists to the benefits and principles of open science such that they can upskill and continue collaborating with NASA science activities. The OpenCore should help participants gain a nuanced **understanding** of the open science ethos and workflow, show participants the tools needed to follow an open science **process** and thus actively participante in open science communities, and help to familiarize participants with the **benefits** of open science to their research and beyond. 

The following is a proposed structure for the OpenCore, to help reinforce these primary objectives.
