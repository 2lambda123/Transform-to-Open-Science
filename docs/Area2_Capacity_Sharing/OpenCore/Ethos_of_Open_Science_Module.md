The TOPS Open Science Module Subject Matter Experts and Leads have been hard at work over the last several months working on the OpenCore modules and I am excited to share the initial draft of the TOPS OpenCore Curriculum Ethos of Open Science module released for public comment. This initial comment phase will be open till Wednesday, September 28, 2022. 

Ethos of Open Science is the first and only required module of the TOPS OpenCore curriculum. It is our expectation that Ethos of Open Science will be the most taught module as it is the introduction course into understanding open science and creates an equal playing field for all to work in open science.

We hope for users to walk away from the course with an understanding of the best practices, community building, and inclusivity that are important to really advancing open science. We aim to create a new, inspired understanding of the importance of sharing knowledge, expanding participation in science, and opening up the entire research process so that we can ask the best questions and find the best answers.

Criteria for Review:
Please keep in mind that this is an initial review of the draft module and is not fully developed with animation, graphics, and videos. The scope of the review is ensure the module concept and goals speak to the needs and concerns of NASA scientists - working in the open or shifting to work in the open. Please keep in mind, not all federally funded scientists are familiar with open science. 

The following criteria is requested:
- Identify Content that may be missing.
- Identify Clarification needed on existing content
- Make Suggestions for enrichment including places where a good teaching example might exist
- Identify terminology that is confusing, problematic or misused for the NASA context

Please avoid:
- Copy-editing
- Writing additional module text
- Designing activities or assessments for modules or lessons
- Definitions of words or terminology used.

To submit your review, please submit your feedback directly in the document and submit [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZjXT4OWuXzLEXx-UrCeqbZSESMUnFio2kUqoFf9YHT8/prefill). The review period will remain open until September 28, 2022.
