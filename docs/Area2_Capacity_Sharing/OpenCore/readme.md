# OpenCore Scope

TOPS aims to meet everyone where they are at on their open science journey. While some members of our growing community may have practiced open science for many years, others may be trying to transition to a new way of conducting research or are students who are looking to begin their scientific careers. As such, TOPS' first priority is to develop the infrastructure to train 20,000 scientists and researchers as part of our five-year program. This community-developed open science curriculum will introduce those beginning their open science journey to important definitions, tools, and resources; and provide participants at all levels recommendations on best practices from subject matter experts. TOPS will initially focus on developing the OpenCore, designed as five modules that mimic a scientific workflow.  

For the 2023 Year of Open Science, TOPS is developing strategic partnerships with scientific associations to teach open science during large annual meetings, special science team summer schools, and other events. The vision for the TOPS OpenCore and other learning resources is for a CC-BY licensed online, open course, hosted on the OpenEDx platform, that can be used to train scientists and award NASA open science badges.

The five OpenCore modules will be:
1. [Ethos of Open Science](./open_science_ethos_module.md)
1. [Open Tools and Resources](./open_tools_module.md)
2. [Open Data](./open_data_module.md)
3. [Open Software](./open_software_module.md)
1. [Open Results](./open_results_module.md)


## Learning Objectives

The OpenCore aims to introduce learners to a nuanced understanding of open science, enabling participants to better understand an open science workflow from end to end. The focus of the curriculum will be on providing learners with a basic understanding of open science, its ethos and benefits, and how to actively participate in open science communities. The TOPS curriculum will also be used to support researchers looking to engage with NASA as NASA moves to adopt more open science requirements (e.g., Scientific Information Policy and ROSES opportunities). Scientists will need to acquire the new skills highlighted in the curriculum to participate in open science effectively and to demonstrate those skills when applying for NASA funding opportunities.


### Researcher core open science skills 
- Have an ORCID
- Be aware of data management and software management plan resources
- How to identify community accepted data and software repositories
- Know how to openly license and share FAIR data and get a DOI assigned to it  
- Know how to apply a permissive license and share open-source software and get a DOI assigned to it
- Understand how to hold open meetings


## Module Structure

The design is for a 12.5-hour course consisting of five, 2.5-hour modules that could be taught in-person during large society meetings or during science team meetings, completed individually online, or completed via group-organized online events. 
* Each course module will be a 2.5-hour interactive learning experience with slides, videos, quizzes, and activities. 
* All content will be integrated into OpenedX 
* All content will be assigned a CC0 or CC-BY license.

Additional information about the module structure can be found on the [module structure page](./OpenCore_structure.md)
