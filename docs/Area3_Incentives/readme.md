# TOPS Incentives development plans

Change is hard. Some scientits will be motivated to adopt open science because it increases their scientific impact, but others may be more motivated by other types of incentives. 

TOPS is working to develop [Open Science Badges](./badging.md) that apply to the [OpenCore](./../Area2_Capacity_Sharing/opencore.md) curriculum. At each module a microbadge is earn and when all 5 are completed the TOPS Open Science Badge is awarded.  

TOPS is working to develop high profile awards in support of open science research. This activity is in formulation over Summer 2022.
