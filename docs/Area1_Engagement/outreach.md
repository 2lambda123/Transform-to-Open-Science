We canâ€™t reach our goals solely through inreach efforts. To reach the broadest of communities, our TOPS team seeks to form equitable partnerships with academic institutions, non-profits, professional societies, and other government agencies. When working with others to build a vibrant equitable community, we define our goals and objectives for groups of community partners, focusing on the roles the community partners serve and potential ways we can collaborate. We co-create thoughtful calls of action and together develop a shared understanding and determine appropriate collaborations that will benefit all parties. 
Here are some ways we collaborate and communicate with communities:

Host listening sessions

Participate in webinars at community meetings

Codevelop open science curricula

Co-create a forum with diverse voices/perspectives

Co-create articles of success

Develop podcast with the Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS), a technical society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)

Collaborate with communities focused on historically underrepresented groups

Promote open science in High Priority Publications, through a roadshow (virtual if necessary) to brief editorial boards of top science publications, publishing pieces in high priority publications - scientific and popular media forms, and write Op-eds in key publications

If your community is interested in working together, please contact us.

Conferences/Workshops

Throughout 2023, the Year of Open Science, TOPS will build capacity for practicing open-source science by attending scientific conferences across the nation. 

Our team will: 

Build our email list and expand our brand footprint 

Engage with large conference societies (i.e. AGU, AMS, AAS, AAAS) to designate 2023 conference theme with a focus of open science

Lead regular discussions of open science practices and initiatives in 2023 and beyond at many major scientific conferences

Educate stakeholders through a comprehensive curriculum workshop

Come get some swag from our booth! We have TOPS stickers and other fun items!
