Open Science is built on community. Central to its success is diversity, inclusivity, accessibility and equity. NASA’s Transform to Open Science (TOPS) efforts can’t be successful without working with diverse communities. When we learn from each other, we all come out stronger. 

With 2023 on the horizon, and The Year of Open Science quickly approaching, our efforts revolve around two primary areas of focus: inreach to existing communities of practice and outreach to communities of potential. 

Critical to these relationships is open, candid, and complete two-way communication.  In the spirit of openness and transparency, the TOPS team will hold a series of community engagement forums. 

Community Forum/ Listening Sessions
These sessions will educate the public about NASA’s OSSI and the TOPS program and create conversation where people can engage with us, give feedback on initiatives, and discuss opportunities and challenges. These sessions will feature an open-source science advocate/practitioner or discuss a topic of interest, followed by a listening session where participants have an opportunity to shape the conversation. The ultimate goal of the sessions is to have the community transition into long-term partnerships with increased community involvement.
