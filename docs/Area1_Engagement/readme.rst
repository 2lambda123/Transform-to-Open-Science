TOPS Engagement Strategy
==========================

TOPS is made up of a small and passionate team that uses `inreach <./inreach.md>`__ and `outreach <./outreach.md>`__ strategies to `create community  <./creating_community.md>`__ and spark positive change towards open science. We are raising awareness, generating excitement, and creating buy-in with stakeholders every day as we move closer to The Year of Open Science kickoff in 2023. 

We know that Open Science creates a more equitable system and broadens participation in science. Reducing barriers to entry for excluded, disenfranchised, and marginalized communities enables more diverse voices and areas of expertise to engage in scientific debate and take part in discovery and innovation. Leveraging more researchers will advance discovery, increase collaboration, and create new knowledge. All these things are essential for scientific discovery in the 21st century. 


The bottom line is that we have ambitious goals and need YOU and your organization to help make a transformation to open science a reality. We have many ways you can get involved with TOPS and we can help bring you tools and resources that will help create an open science infrastructure within your own organization.
