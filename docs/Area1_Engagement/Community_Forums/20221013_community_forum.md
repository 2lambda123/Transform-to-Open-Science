This month we will be talking about and taking questions on the new funding opportunity: [F.14 Transform to OPen Science Training (TOPST)](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?solId=%7bAB776446-03A8-4C24-845D-2E5A2ADA2D5A%7d&path=&method=init). 
- Notice of Intent Due 11/10 
- Proposals Due 12/8

TOPST is seeks applications to support the following three activities:
(1) Development of ScienceCore materials (see Section 3.1),
(2) Implementation of summer schools (see Section 3.2.1), and
(3) Virtual cohorts (see Section 3.2.2).

We will discuss the requirements for each section, point out resources NASA has to help you write a good proposal, and answer questions.
