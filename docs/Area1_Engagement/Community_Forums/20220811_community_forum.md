# TOPS Community Forum - August 2022

 We want to hear from you! 
 - If you already *do* open science, what helped you? 
 - If you *want* to do open science, what help do you need? 
 
This forum will first provide an overview of OpenCore, TOPS Open Science curriculum, topics. OpenCore is being designed as a practical guide for scientists who want to learn how to do open science.
Then we will break out into smaller groups to have an in-depth discussion of each of the topics: 
- Ethos of Open Science 
- Open Tools
- Open Software 
- Open Data
- Open Results
