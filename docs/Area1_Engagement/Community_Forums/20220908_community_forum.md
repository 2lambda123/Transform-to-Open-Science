# TOPS Community Forum - September 2022

Join us this month to delve into two NASA Science Mission Directorate Divisions: Biological and Physical Sciences and Heliophysics, to learn more about those domain-specific open science activities. Even if those arenâ€™t your fields of expertise, we encourage you to attend. We also would like feedback on related open science activities in the other domains (Astrophysics, Planetary Science and Earth Science), points where different domains' efforts could benefit and augment one another, and facilitate a discussion about trust and adoption.
