# TOPS Engagement Strategy
TOPS is made up of a small and passionate team that uses [inreach](./docs/Area1_Engagement/inreach.md) and [outreach](./docs/Area1_Engagement/outreach.md) strategies to create community and spark positive change towards open science. Our team is building a vibrant open science community that will change the future of science. We are raising awareness, generating excitement, and creating buy-in with stakeholders every day as we move closer to The Year of Open Science kickoff in 2023. 

We need your participation to be successful! There are many ways you can engage with us! We use mediated and face-to-face practices that increase open-science visibility, create knowledge, and build partnerships that advance open-science. 

We know that Open Science creates a more equitable system and broadens participation in science. Reducing barriers to entry for excluded, disenfranchised, and marginalized communities enables more diverse voices and areas of expertise to engage in scientific debate and take part in discovery and innovation. Leveraging more researchers will advance discovery, increase collaboration, and create new knowledge. All these things are essential for scientific discovery in the 21st century. 

Open Science is a Best Practice and can help you, your organization, your research’s impact. TOPS understands that doing open science is great for science careers at all levels and in securing future funding. Funding trends indicate that open science may play a key role in securing funding from Federal Agencies. Participation will also be weighted heavily in criteria for awards, credentials, evaluations and impact policy.
Open, FAIR data gets more use & citations. 
Open software increases trust in and transparency of results  
Open results increases reproducibility and expands possible collaborations. 
Open access increases citations and impact for you and your research team! 

The bottom line is that we have ambitious goals and need YOU and your organization to help make a transformation to open science a reality. We have many ways you can get involved with TOPS and we can help bring you tools and resources that will help create an open science infrastructure within your own organization.
