# TOPST Proposal Elements: Open-Science Development Plans and Equal Access Plans
TOPST requires both an Open-Source Science Development Plan (replaces the Data Management Plan) and an Equal Access Plan. We provide more information on both below. 

## Open-Source Science Development Plan
* Proposals must submit an Open-Source Science Development Plan that describes how project materials will be openly available. 
* It must conform to [Earth Science Division guidelines](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/engage/open-data-services-and-software/). 
* **The plan must describe:**
     * The management of the materials developed as part of the project and how they will be released openly. 
     * If data or software are planned to be created, they each get their own subsection that includes a description of how these will be managed, archived, and shared openly. 
* The plan may be up to **two pages**, is [anonymized](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=896942/solicitationId=%7BAB776446-03A8-4C24-845D-2E5A2ADA2D5A%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/DAPRguidelines22SMD.pdf), is included in the main proposal PDF, immediately following the references and citations for the Science/Technical/Management Section (S/T/M) section of the proposal. 
* This Open-Source Science Development Plan replaces the standard ROSES requirement for a Data Management Plan.
