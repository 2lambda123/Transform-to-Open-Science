## US Federal Agencies Timeline to Open Science 

This provides a timeline of agency policies and changes to advance open science. 

### 2013 Holdren Memo
2013 [Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf)
Also known here at NIST as the OSTP Memo, it calls for all Federal agencies with research and development expenditures above $100 million to develop a Public Access Plan to support increased public access to the results of this research – specifically data produced in the course of that research. A summary of how this is impacting science is [here](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/02/22/increasing-access-results-federally-funded-science)

2019 **NASA** Policy: Releases [Strategy for Data Management and Computing for Groundbreaking Science 2019-2024](https://science.nasa.gov/science-pink/s3fs-public/atoms/files/SDMWG_Full%20Document_v3.pdf). The strategy is designed to enable transformational open science through continuous evolution of science data and
computing systems for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. 

2020 **NASA** Funding: First in a series of NASA funding announcements to support [open science](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/solicitations!init.do#:~:text=E.7%20Support%20for%20Open%20Source%20Tools%2C%20Frameworks%2C%20and%20Libraries).

2021 **NASA** Policy: Releases a new [scientific information policy](https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/Scientific%20Information%20policy%20SPD-41.pdf) that describes how scientific information produced from SMD funding is shared. Scientific information includes publications, data, and software produced as part of scientific research activities.
