# US Federal Agencies Timeline to Open Science
The journey towards open science has been supported since 2013 with key policy changes by the federal government. Here is a living timeline detailing some of the major actions.

## 2013 
### OSTP’s “The Holdren Memo”
The [Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf) policy memorandum directed US Federal agencies with research and development expenditures above $100 million to develop public access plans to support increased public access to the results of this research. Dr. John Holdren responded directly to a We The People petition about the memo when it was released, and that can be read [here](https://petitions.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/response/increasing-public-access-results-scientific-research/ ). A White House summary from 2016 about the ongoing impact of the memo can be found [here](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/02/22/increasing-access-results-federally-funded-science ).

## 2019
### NASA’s Strategy for Data Management and Computing
The [Strategy for Data Management and Computing for Groundbreaking Science 2019-2024](https://science.nasa.gov/science-pink/s3fs-public/atoms/files/SDMWG_Full%20Document_v3.pdf) is released. It is designed to “enable transformational open science through continuous evolution of science data and computing systems for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.” Part of this strategy, “to develop and implement capabilities to enable open science” is the predecessor to TOPS.

## 2020
### NASA Funding Released
In 2020, NASA released its first announcements to support [open science](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/solicitations!init.do#:~:text=E.7%20Support%20for%20Open%20Source%20Tools%2C%20Frameworks%2C%20and%20Libraries ).

## 2021
### NASA’s SPD-41
NASA released the Scientific Information policy for the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Policy Document 41 or [“SPD-41”](https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/Scientific%20Information%20policy%20SPD-41.pdf ). This policy describes how any scientific information produced using funding from SMD is shared. Scientific information, in this case, includes publications, data, and software produced as part of scientific research activities.
