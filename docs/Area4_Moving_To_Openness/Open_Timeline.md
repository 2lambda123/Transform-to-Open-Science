# US Federal Agencies Timeline to Open Science
The journey towards open science has been supported since 2013 with key policy changes by the federal government. Here is a living timeline detailing some of the major actions.

## 2013 
### OSTP’s “The Holdren Memo”
The [Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf) policy memorandum directed US Federal agencies with research and development expenditures above $100 million to develop public access plans (see below) to support increased public access to the results of this research. Dr. John Holdren responded directly to a *We The People* petition about the memo when it was released, and that can be read [here](https://petitions.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/response/increasing-public-access-results-scientific-research/). A White House summary from 2016 about the ongoing impact of the memo can be found [here](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/02/22/increasing-access-results-federally-funded-science).

## 2014
### Public Access Plans
* Department of Agriculture [public access plan](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USDA-Public-Access-Implementation-Plan.pdf)
* Department of Energy [public access plan](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/08/f18/DOE_Public_Access%20Plan_FINAL.pdf)
* National Aeronautics and Space Administration [public access plan](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/206985_2015_nasa_plan-for-web.pdf)

### DOE PAGES
The DOE leverages its existing infrastructure from the [Scientific and Technical Information Program (STIP)](https://www.osti.gov/stip) to create an online portal, the Department of Energy Public Access Gateway for Energy and Science or [DOE PAGES](https://www.osti.gov/pages/faqs#doe-pages-overview), to make "peer-reviewed scholarly scientific publications resulting from DOE research funding publicly accessible to read, download, and analyze." A useful feature of PAGES is that it reconciles DOIs from DOE authors, selecting one as the "authoritative" source for all further citations. 

## 2015
### NIST Public Access to Results Policy
NIST's [Managing Public Access to Results of Federally Funded Research Policy](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2018/06/19/final_p_5700.pdf) states that NIST will "promote the deposit of scientific data arising from unclassified research and programs...free of charge in publicly accessible database." This policy does not apply to Standard Reference Data, which NIST has the authority to license. NIST data and results can be found in the following online locations:
  * [NIST website](https://www.nist.gov/publications)
  * Peer-reviewed papers are in [PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/funder/nist/)
  * NIST Technical series and other papers not subject to peer-review are in [govinfo](https://www.govinfo.gov/collection/nist)
  * NIST data is available through the [Science Data Portal](https://data.nist.gov/sdp/#/) and on [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)

### USDA's Scientific Integrity Policy 
The USDA's [Scientific Integrity Policy](https://www.usda.gov/directives/dr-1074-001) or DR 1074-001 is designed to "ensure the highest level of integrity in all aspects of the Department’s and USDA agencies’ involvement with scientific and technological processes, research, analyses, and products" including the open, accessible and online distribution of all scientific data used to develop policy. 

## 2018
### The OPEN Government Data Act
Title II of Public Law 115-435, [Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-115publ435/pdf/PLAW-115publ435.pdf) requires for Federal agencies to publish their data online, and as open data. 

## 2019
### NASA’s Strategy for Data Management and Computing
The [Strategy for Data Management and Computing for Groundbreaking Science 2019-2024](https://science.nasa.gov/science-pink/s3fs-public/atoms/files/SDMWG_Full%20Document_v3.pdf) is released. It is designed to “enable transformational open science through continuous evolution of science data and computing systems for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.” Part of this strategy, “to develop and implement capabilities to enable open science” is the predecessor to TOPS.

## 2020
### NASA Funding Released
In 2020, NASA released its first announcements to support [open science](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/solicitations!init.do#:~:text=E.7%20Support%20for%20Open%20Source%20Tools%2C%20Frameworks%2C%20and%20Libraries ).

## 2021
### NASA’s SPD-41
NASA released the Scientific Information policy for the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Policy Document 41 or [“SPD-41”](https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/Scientific%20Information%20policy%20SPD-41.pdf ). This policy describes how any scientific information produced using funding from SMD is shared. Scientific information, in this case, includes publications, data, and software produced as part of scientific research activities.

## 2022
### USDA's Public Access to Scholarly Publications and Digital Scientific Research Data
In accordance with their public access plan, USDA releases DR 1020-006, [Public Access to Scholarly Publications and
Digital Scientific Research Data](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/dr-1020-006.pdf), requiring that all USDA "peer-reviewed, scholarly
publications and digital scientific research data assets arising from unclassified scientific research" will be made "accessible to the public, to the extent practicable."
