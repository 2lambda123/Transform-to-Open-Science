# US Federal Agencies Timeline to Open Science
The journey towards open science has been supported since 2013 with key policy changes by the federal government. Here is a living timeline detailing some of the major actions.

## 2013 
### OSTP’s “The Holdren Memo”
The [Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf) policy memorandum directed US Federal agencies with research and development expenditures above $100 million to develop public access plans (see below) to support increased public access to the results of this research. Dr. John Holdren responded directly to a *We The People* petition about the memo when it was released, and that can be read [here](https://petitions.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/response/increasing-public-access-results-scientific-research/). A White House summary from 2016 about the ongoing impact of the memo can be found [here](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/02/22/increasing-access-results-federally-funded-science).

## 2014
### DOE PAGES
The DOE leveraged its existing infrastructure from the [Scientific and Technical Information Program (STIP)](https://www.osti.gov/stip) to create an online portal, the Department of Energy Public Access Gateway for Energy and Science or [DOE PAGES](https://www.osti.gov/pages/faqs#doe-pages-overview), to make "peer-reviewed scholarly scientific publications resulting from DOE research funding publicly accessible to read, download, and analyze." A useful feature of PAGES is that it reconciles DOIs from DOE authors, selecting one as the "authoritative" source for all further citations. 

### DoD Public Access Policy
A precursor to the DoD's public access plan was the [Public Access to the Results of Department of Defense-Funded Research](https://discover.dtic.mil/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/memo_public_access_kendall_20140709.pdf) which directed all authors funded by the DoD to submit final, peer-reviewed journal manuscripts to [Defense Technical Information Center](https://discover.dtic.mil/).

### Public Access Plans
* Department of Agriculture [public access plan](https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USDA-Public-Access-Implementation-Plan.pdf)
* Department of Energy [public access plan](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2014/08/f18/DOE_Public_Access%20Plan_FINAL.pdf)
* National Aeronautics and Space Administration [public access plan](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/206985_2015_nasa_plan-for-web.pdf)

## 2015
### NIST Public Access to Results Policy
NIST's [Managing Public Access to Results of Federally Funded Research Policy](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2018/06/19/final_p_5700.pdf) stated that NIST will "promote the deposit of scientific data arising from unclassified research and programs...free of charge in publicly accessible database." This policy does not apply to Standard Reference Data, which NIST has the authority to license. Release of the policy was accompanied by guidance on [Managing Public Access to Results of Funded Research](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2019/11/08/final_o_5701_ver_2.pdf).

NIST data and results can be found in the following online locations: [NIST website](https://www.nist.gov/publications), Peer-reviewed papers are in [PMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/funder/nist/), NIST Technical series and other papers not subject to peer-review are in [govinfo](https://www.govinfo.gov/collection/nist), and NIST data is available through the [Science Data Portal](https://data.nist.gov/sdp/#/) and on [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/).

### NOAA Public Access Policy
Accompanying its public access plan, NOAA released a new policy on [Public Access Policy for Scholarly Publications](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/10171). This policy required NOAA publishers "to submit all digital NOAA research publications" to the "NOAA Central Library for inclusion in the [NOAA Institutional Repository](https://repository.library.noaa.gov/)."

## 2016
### USDA's Scientific Integrity Policy 
The USDA's [Scientific Integrity Policy](https://www.usda.gov/directives/dr-1074-001) or DR 1074-001 is designed to "ensure the highest level of integrity in all aspects of the Department’s and USDA agencies’ involvement with scientific and technological processes, research, analyses, and products" including the open, accessible and online distribution of all scientific data used to develop policy. 

### Revised NOAA Data Sharing Policy
As a result of NOAA's public access plan, its [Data and Publication Sharing Directive for NOAA Grants, Cooperative Agreements, and Contracts](https://nosc.noaa.gov/EDMC/PD.DSP.php) from 2012 is revised to impose requirements regarding the sharing of proposals as well as resaerch data in a timlely fashion  "both on NOAA Programs that issue grants and on grant recipients." Specifically, it required that "data that
underlie the conclusions of peer-reviewed scientific publications be made available for discovery, retrieval, and analysis for free at the time of publication." This data is submitted to the NOAA National Data Centers for archiving.

### NIST Releases Additional Guidance
In November of 2017, NIST released three, seperate directives to further clarify and provide resources regarding its public access policy. These are the [Guidance for Review of Data Management Plans Submitted with Applications and Proposals for NIST Funding for Scientific Research](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2021/01/11/final-g-5701-ver-2.pdf), the order on the [Preservation and Maintenance of Published Research Data](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2019/11/12/final_o_5702_1.pdf), and procedures on [Managing Public Access to External Research Funded by NIST](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2018/06/19/final_pr_5702.01_0.pdf). 

## 2018
### The OPEN Government Data Act
Title II of Public Law 115-435, [Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-115publ435/pdf/PLAW-115publ435.pdf) requires for Federal agencies to publish their data online, and as open data. 

## Guidance on Sharing Data Using NIST Infrastructure
Further, clarifying guidance on how individual researchers or research groups should share non-NIST data used in NIST-funded research is released in [Guidance for Making Non-NIST Data Available Through NIST’s Data Management Infrastructure](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2018/06/19/final_g_5702_01.pdf).

## DoD Scientific and Technical Information Program
